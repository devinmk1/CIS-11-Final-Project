- Option B: Test Score Calculator

# Description
In this program the user is prompted to input 5 test scores ranging form 0-99 where the user will receive a letter grade equivalent score and have their maximum grade, minimum grade, and avergae score displayed. 

# Approach 
In this program we approaced it in a way that we assume the user is already a student who has already done atleast 5 quizes or exams and is someone that wants to calculate their test scores. When programming we decided to make use of multiple functions to get the user's grade, calculate the grade average, maximum grade, and minimum grade. While getting the user's letter grade, we PUSH the letter onto the stack, and POP it from the stack when we want to display the user's letter grade.

# Simple Instructions
When entering the test scores, type the number grade you want to input. (0 - 99)
For Example, type '97' if you got a score of 97 on your previous test.
